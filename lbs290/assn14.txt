                 ASSIGNMENT 14 - ARRAYS

Due Date: Before Lecture 11/06/91

The purpose of this program is to work with arrays.

The program will create a 10 element array and read in 10 integers
into the array.  Then the program will print the integers backwards.
Then the program will scan for entries in the array which contain the
value 100 and print out the index of the entries with the number 100.
The program will also count the number of entries which equal 100.
The program should work even if there are no entries which equal 100.

An example run will look as follows:

$ a.out
Enter a number:  9
Enter a number:  5
Enter a number:  100
Enter a number:  16
Enter a number:  18
Enter a number:  20
Enter a number:  6
Enter a number:  100
Enter a number:  1
Enter a number:  77

numb[9] = 77
numb[8] = 1
numb[7] = 100
numb[6] = 6
numb[5] = 20 
numb[4] = 18 
numb[3] = 16
numb[2] = 100
numb[1] = 5
numb[0] = 9

Searching for entries equal to 100

Found 100 at 2
Found 100 at 7

Found 2 entries with 100
