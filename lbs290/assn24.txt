                 ASSIGNMENT 24 - PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

Due Date: 5 points Extra Credit Due 12/12/91 Noon

The purpose of this program is to implement a simple payroll for 
a small company.  The input records consist of an employee number
rate, and number of hours.  The following is an example record:

  1 7.30 40.0

The program will calculate the pay for each employee, allowing time 
and a half for worked over 40.

The program will also calculate federal taxes for the person.  The tax table
is as follows:

    Gross Pay     Taxes
   ---------------------
   0 < pay < 200    - 0 - 
   pay >= 200      50% of the amount over 200

For example the taxes on $250.00 would be $25.00.

As each record is read, print out the employee, rate, gross pay, taxes,
and net pay.

There will be multiple pay records per person.  As each pay record is 
printed, you must save the gross pay and taxes for the employee (hint:
the employee number will always be between 0 and 9).

Use end-of-file to terminate the program.

At the end of the program, print out a list of all of the employees
who have been paid throughout the year and show their total gross pay
and total taxes withheld for the year.

If you get an illegal employee number, print a message and do no 
pay calculation.

Example execution:

$ a.out
Enter: 1 7.00 40.00
Emp=1 Rate=7.00 Hours=40.0 Gross=280.00 Taxes=40.00 Net=240.00
Enter: 3 5.00 45.00
Emp=3 Rate=5.00 Hours=45.0 Gross=237.50 Taxes=18.75 Net=218.75
Enter: 1 7.00 20.00
Emp=1 Rate=7.00 Hours=20.0 Gross=140.00 Taxes=0.00 Net=140.00
