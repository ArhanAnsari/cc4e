1.    #include <stdio.h>
      main() {
        int age;
        scanf("%d",&age);
        age = age + 2;
        printf("%d",age);
      }

2.     /* Why doesn't this program work?        Missing */
       #include                                 Missing <stdio.h>
       main ()
       }                                        Bracket wrong
       int x;
       float y;
       float z                                  Missing semicolon
       /* Any problems so far? */
       x = 4;
       y = x * 3;
       z = y + 5.0;
       Printf(\n The value of z is %d\n", z);   Missing "
                                                Printf should be printf
       }

3.    #include <stdio.h>
      main() {
        double a,b,c,d;
        printf("Enter the value for a:");
        scanf("%lf",&a);
        printf("Enter the value for b:");
        scanf("%lf",&b);
        printf("Enter the value for c:");
        scanf("%lf",&c);
        d = a * b * c;
        printf("The answer is %lf\n",d);
      }

4.     arf.c - source code - readable by humans - input to the comiler
       a.out - executable machine code - produced by the compiler
       glom - program output - readable by people

5.    f = 1.0 + 2.0 * 3.0 / 4.0 + 3.0 / 6.0;      f 3.0
      i = 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6;                  i 33
      i = 1 + ( 2 * 3 ) + 4 * (5 + 6);            i 45
      i = 107.0 / 109.01;                         i 0
      f = 1 / 10;                                 f 0.0

6.    %d - Integer
      %f - float
      %lf - double

7.   c.  Exponential statements

8.  Syntax error will be detected by the compiler. No a.out will be produces.
run time errors are not caught by the compiler.  The program just produces 
incorrect results.

The compiler translates a program in a programming language such as C into 
machine language.  a.out contains the machine language for the program.  It
is only readable by the computer.

Variable names must start with a letter or underscore.  Variables can 
have letters, numbers or underscores.
