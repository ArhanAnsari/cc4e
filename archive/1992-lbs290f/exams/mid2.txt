This exam is closed book, closed notes.  There are 4 questions on 5 pages.
This exam is worth 20% of your final grade.  The questions are equally
weighted.  Each is worth 25 points.


1.    Assume the following variables:

      Variable   Contents             Type
      ---------------------------------------
      EMPNO      Employee Number      INTEGER
      RATE       Pay Rate             REAL
      HOURS      Hours worked         REAL
      GROSS      Gross Pay            REAL
      TAXES      Taxes withheld       REAL
      NETPAY     Net Pay              REAL

      Write a print statement and format statement which would print the
      values out in the following columns:

           EMPNO      RATE     HOURS      GROSS     TAXES     NETPAY 


          7       12.50     40.00      500.00    125.00    375.00
   
      123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
      Columns  1         2         3         4         5         6

      Your code must be able to handle real numbers up to 9999.99
      and employee numbers up to 9999.  

      NOTE: The answer to this question is NOT a whole program.  It is
      just two FORTRAN statements.  You do not have to read or calculate
      the values for this question - just print them out in the correct
      format.

2.    Complete the following program by writing the appropriate
      SUBROUTINE to calculate gross pay and taxes given rate and hours.

      Gross pay is calculated by multiplying the rate times the number
      of hours allowing time and a half for worked over 40.

      The tax table is as follows:

          Gross Pay     Taxes
         ---------------------
         0 < pay < 200    - 0 - 
         pay >= 200      50% of the amount over 200

      For example the taxes on $250.00 would be $25.00.

      Program:

         REAL PAY,RATE,HOURS,GROSS,TAXES

         PRINT *,'Enter the values-'
         READ *,RATE,HOURS

         CALL CALCPAY(GROSS,TAXES,RATE,HOURS)

         NET = GROSS - TAXES
         PRINT *,'Gross is   ',GROSS
         PRINT *,'Taxes are  ',TAXES
         PRINT *,'Net Pay is ',NET
         END

3.   READ this question carefully.  There are some small differences 
     between this question and the previously assigned program.

     The purpose of this program is to track an inventory of 
     a small business.

     The program will track up to 10 parts with part numbers ranging from 1 
     to 10.

     Each line read by the program is an inventory control record.  The first
     number indicates the type of transaction - 1 Stock 2 Sell.
     The second number is the part number.  The last number is the number
     of parts bought or sold.

     Example input:

      1 2 20  Stocked 20 of part 2
      2 4 5  Sold 5 of part 4

     The program must check for an illegal transaction type.  The program 
     must check for an error in the part number.  The program also
     must also not allow product to be sold if there is none in stock.

     The program will print the ending inventory when CTRL-D is entered.

     Example execution:

      $ a.out
      Enter the inventory control record: 3 0 0 
      
      Error - Illegal transaction type 
      
      Enter the inventory control record: 1 20 90 
      
      Error - Part number 20 too large
      
      Enter the inventory control record: 2 4 5
      
      Error - current inventory of part 4 is 0, cannot sell 5
      
      Enter the inventory control record: 1 2 20
      Enter the inventory control record: 1 4 10
      Enter the inventory control record: 2 2 5
      Enter the inventory control record: (CTRL-D)
      
        PART   COUNT
        ----   -----
          2      15
          4      10
      
      Thank you for using the inventory program.

Answer to question 3.

4.    This program will read in exactly 10 numbers into an array, sort
      the array so that the larger numbers are at the top (decending
      order) and print out the sorted array.
