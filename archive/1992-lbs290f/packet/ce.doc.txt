CE Text Editor v1.1a Beta                    (c)1991 Charles Henrich

1.0 Introduction

    Welcome to CE.  This editor was written with you in mind.  The
    editor was written with one goal in mind, and that was to be very
    very easy to use.  I think I have achieved this goal, and it is
    hoped that you will be able to use this editor like an expert within
    ten minutes of its first use.

3.0 Getting Started

    There are two ways to start the CE editor, the first is to just type
    its name, and the second is to type its name as well as a file name,
    like so:

    ce assignment1.f 

    If the file assignment1.c exists, it will be loaded into the editor, if
    not, the editor will come up as if you had typed no name.
    For a quick reference of all commands in CE, just type ESC then h.
