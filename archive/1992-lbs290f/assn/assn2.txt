                 ASSIGNMENT 2 - Speed Conversion

Due Date: April 6, 1992 11:59PM

The purpose of this program is to prompt for a number of miles per hour,
convert it to feet per second, and print out the converted speed in
feet per second.

Useful numbers:

  5280  feet per mile
  3600  seconds per hour

One technique might be to convert from miles per hour to feet per hour
and then convert from feet per hour to feet per second.


Example execution:

   $ a.out
