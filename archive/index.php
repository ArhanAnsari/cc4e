This is a picture of Dr. Chuck's undergraduate project for the year-long compiler
course in 1980.  He was the first and last student at the Michigan State University 
Computer Science Deptartment to do the compiler project
in Pascal.  He was also one of the few students that took two years to do a one year project
and insisted he do the project by himself :)
