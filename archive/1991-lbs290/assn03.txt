                 ASSIGNMENT 3 - THE FIRST C PROGRAM

Enter the program in section 1.3 of the textbook into the file assn3.c
using vi (or cat if you like).

Due: Before lecture 10/7/91

You may get a printed copy of the file using the command:

  spool assn3.c

To execute this program you must run it through the C language compiler
using the following command:

  cc assn3.c

If you don't get any errors from the cc command you can run the
program by typing:

  a.out

The program should produce the correct output as described in the book.o

If you get errors when you run the C-compiler, you must fix them before
continuing.  The following is an example of an error:

   $ cc assn3.c
   "assn3.c", line 8: syntax error
   "assn3.c", line 10: moles undefined
   $ 

This error message is indicating that something is wrong on lines
8 and 10 of the program.  A semi-colon was missnig on line 8 and 
miles was mis-spelled on line 10.

Edit the program in assn3.c until it compiles with no errors.

Run the program using a.out and make sure it produces the proper output.

To turn in the program once it works use the following commands:

  rm assn3.handin
  cp assn3.c assn3.handin
  a.out >> assn3.handin

The output of the a.out command will not appear on the terminal.  You
can check the contents of assn3.handin as follows:

  more assn3.handin

You should see both the program and the results of executing the 
program.  To hand it in, type:

  mailx crs < assn3.handin
