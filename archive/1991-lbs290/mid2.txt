2.     Write a program using a for loop to print out the 
       following numbers.  You must use only one printf
       statement.

3.     You are to write a function to calculate the rate of pay for an
       employee.  Your function will be called as follows:

         float pay;
         float rate;
         float hours;
         int emptype;

         calcpay(&pay,rate,hours,emptype);

       There are three types of employees.  The variable emptype tells
       you the type of employee:

       emptype=1 Exempt employee - Paid for 40 hours regardless of how
       much time they work.

       emptype=2 Hourly employee - Paid time and a half for hours > 40

       emptype=3 Union employee - Paid double time for hours > 40

       If you are passed an invalid employee type, set the pay to 0.0.

4.     Correct the errors in the following program.  There are at least
       seven errors in this program.


          Why doesn't this program work? */

       #include <stdio.h>

       main ()
       {
       
         integer x;
         float y;
         float z;
       
         x = 9;
         y = 7;
         z = func1(&x,&y);
         func2(y,z);
       }

       float func1(a,b);
         int *a;
         int *b;
       {
         tmp = (*a + *b) / 2;
         *a = tmp + 1;

         return 100.0;
       }
       
       func2(m,n)
        float *m;
        float n;
       {
          *m = n + 1;
       }

6.     What will the following C program print out?  Show the output below
       in the correct order.

       int a;
       
       main() {

         int i,j,k;

         a = 19;
         i = 5;
         j = 3;
         k = 2;
         printf("Main-1 %d %d %d %d\n",a,i,j,k);
         k = funca(i,j);
         printf("Main-2 %d %d %d %d\n",a,i,j,k);
         funcb(&i,j);
         printf("Main-3 %d %d %d %d\n",a,i,j,k);
       
       }
       
       funca(m,n)
         int m;
         int n;
       {
         int a;
       
         a = m + n;
         printf("funca-1 %d %d %d\n",a,m,n);
         m = n - 1;
         n = 0;
         printf("funca-2 %d %d %d\n",a,m,n);
         return a;
       }
       
       funcb(m,n)
         int *m;
         int n;
       {
         a = *m + n;
         printf("funcb-1 %d %d %d\n",a,*m,n);
         *m = 17;
       }

(2 pts.)
7.    The following program will blow up on briggs1 with the following
      message:

      EMT trap - core dumped

      What line of the following program will be executing when this
      message comes out?


      main() {
        int a;
        select(&a);
      }
      
      select(b)
        int *b;
      {
        b = 5;
        printf("%d\n",b);
        *b = 9;
       }

(9 pts.)
8.    You are to write a function called mystrlen.  This function will
      count the number of characters in a string and return the 
      count.

      Your function would be called as follows:

        char str[100];

        i = mystrlen(str);

      Do NOT use the function strlen from C - you are to write this

(5 pts)
9.     Write a program to do the following:

       1.  Read in a 5 element integer array

       2.  Find the minimum number in the array and print it out

       3.  Go through the array and set all array elements that are
           less than zero to zero.
     
       4.  Print out the array.
