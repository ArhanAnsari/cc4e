                 ASSIGNMENT 9 - IF STATEMENTS

Due Date: Before Lecture 10/23/91

Like assignment 7, this program will prompt for three variables
and calculate the roots of a quadratic formula.

However it will check to see that the determinant:

                   2
  determinant  =  b  - 4ac

Is greater than or equal zero before calling sqrt.  This will
keep the program from getting a domain error.

When the program has a negative determinant, it should print out:

Negative determinant - no roots found

In this version of the program it IS wrong to blow up with a domain
error.


Example executions:

  $ a.out
  Enter the value for a: 1.0
  Enter the value for b: -3.0
  Enter the value for c: 2.0

  First root: 2.0
  Second root: 1.0

  $ a.out
  Enter the value for a: 1.0
  Enter the value for b: 2.0
  Enter the value for c: 8.0

  Negative determinant - no roots found

Once again run the program for the values:

a=1 b=-3 c=2
a=1 b=2 c=1
a=1 b=2 c=8

Hand in only the program source code using mailx.
