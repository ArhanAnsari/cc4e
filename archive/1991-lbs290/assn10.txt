                 ASSIGNMENT 10 - LOOPING

Due Date: Before Lecture 10/25/91

This assignment is a modification to assignment 9.  Add a for loop
to your program to prompt for three sets of numbers each time
the program is run.

You should calculate the roots as before.

Like assignment 9 it IS wrong to blow up with a domain error.


Example execution:

  $ a.out
  Enter the value for a: 1.0
  Enter the value for b: -3.0
  Enter the value for c: 2.0

  First root: 2.0
  Second root: 1.0

  Enter the value for a: 1.0
  Enter the value for b: 2.0
  Enter the value for c: 8.0

  Negative determinant - no roots found

  Enter the value for a: 1.0
  Enter the value for b: 2.0
  Enter the value for c: 1.0

  First root: -1.0
  Second root: -1.0

  $

Run the program for the values:

a=1 b=-3 c=2
a=1 b=2 c=8
a=1 b=2 c=1

Hand in only the program source code using mailx.
