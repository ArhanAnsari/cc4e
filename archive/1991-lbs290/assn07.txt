                 ASSIGNMENT 7 - INPUT AND OUTPUT

Due Date: Before Lecture 10/16/91

Alter the program from assignment 6 to prompt for the values
of a, b, and c using scanf.

The program will execute as follows:

  $ a.out
  Enter the value for a: 1.0
  Enter the value for b: -3.0
  Enter the value for c: 2.0

  First root: 2.0
  Second root: 1.0

Once again run the program for the values:

a=1 b=-3 c=2
a=1 b=2 c=1

Also run the program with the values:

a=1 b=2 c=8

What happens?  Why does this happen?

Hand in only the program source code using mailx.
