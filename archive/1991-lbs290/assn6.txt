                 ASSIGNMENT 6 - Mathematics

Write a program which will calculate the quadratic formula to find the
roots of a ploynomial.

Due Date: Before Lecture 10/14/91

The formula for the value of x in a polynomial of the form:
     
           2
       a x    +   b  x   +  c  = 0

 
is:

                     2
         - b  +     b   - 4ac
x  =    --------------------- 
                  2a

and

                     2
         - b  -     b   - 4ac
x  =    --------------------- 
                  2a


Write a program which has three double precision variables
a, b,  and c.  The program will calculate the values for x
using the above formula.  The output of the program should look
like:

  Value for a: 1.0
  Value for b: -3.0
  Value for c: 2.0

  First root: 2.0
  Second root: 1.0

Run the program for the values:

a=1 b=-3 c=2
a=1 b=2 c=1

Also run the program with the values:

a=1 b=2 c=8

What happens?  Why does this happen?

Hand in the program and program output using mailx.  See assignment 3 
for details on how to hand in the program and its output.
