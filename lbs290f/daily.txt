Program development process.

Log on to the UNIX system.

Create a file prog1.f using the ce text editor.

Compilation process - What is a compiler?
  -   Looks at program
      -  High level language - looks nice but won't execute
  -   First checks for screw-ups - syntax errors - a program with
      syntax errors cannot be run - it will not compile.
  -   If there are syntax errors - you must fix them and re-compile.
  -   If no syntax errors - compiler generates machine code in the
      file a.out - looks terrible - executes nicely.
  -   Program actually runs when a.out is typed.
