Syllabus           LBS290F - FORTRAN with Applications        Spring 1992

Course Description:  This "team taught" course is designed to teach 
programming principles using the FORTRAN language and to provide experience
with applications tailored to biology or calculus.

Prerequisites: Section 2 - LBS140 or one term of college biology.  
Section 3 - LBS 113 or concurrent enrollment.

Textbook: Structured FORTRAN 77 for Engineers and Scientists, Third 
Edition, by D.M. Etter, Benjamin Cummings, 1990.  Suggested is Introducing
UNIX System V, Morgan & McGilton, McGraw-Hill 1987.  There is a course packet
from Kinkos.  The course packet contains required materials.  The couse packet
number is 84.

The course is broken down into two basic sections:

  Part I (6 weeks)      Problem analysis and programming in FORTRAN.
                        Algorithms, control structures, simple data
                        Structures and Input-Output.
                        Functions and Subroutines.

  Part II (4 weeks)     Application specific section (Biology/Calculus)

Part I is taught by the computer science instructor as a common
lecture to both sections in room C104.  Part II is taught as 
separate sections by the biology (C104) and calculus (C103) instructors.  
The computer science instructor will be available during part II and 
IV for assistance with the FORTRAN language and other computing questions.

The final grade for the class is broken down as follows:

  Computer Science:
  Programming Assignments                        20%
  In Class Test I                                20%
  In Class Test II                               20%

  Application Area:
  Programming Assignments                        20%
  In Class Tests                                 20%

Make up tests will only be scheduled with verified medical excuses. 
Requests for make-up tests must be submitted in writing with a Physician's
excuse.

Turning in another person's assignment as your own is NOT allowed and 
if a student turns in a copy or slightly modified copy of someone 
else's assignment both students will receive a zero for that assignment.

Final Grades will be computed based on the overall average as follows:
    93%     4.0        83%    3.0         73%   2.0
    88%     3.5        78%    2.5         Below 0.0
