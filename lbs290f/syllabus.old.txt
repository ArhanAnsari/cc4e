Syllabus           LBS290F - FORTRAN with Applications        Spring 1992

Course Description:  This "team taught" course is designed to teach 
programming principles using the FORTRAN language and to provide experience
with applications tailored to biology or calculus.

Prerequisites: Section 2 - LBS140 or one term of college biology.  
Section 3 - LBS 113 or concurrent enrollment.

Instructors:
Computer Science:  Charles Severance, Office E-190, Phone 353-1759.
                   Office Hours: MW 6PM-7:30PM, Thurs 1:00-2:00

Biology:           Hagerman, Office is W-36, 353-4763
                  
Calculus:          Simpson, Office is E-186, 336-1509

Textbook: Structured FORTRAN 77 for Engineers and Scientists, Third 
Edition, by D.M. Etter, Benjamin Cummings, 1990.  Suggested is Introducing
UNIX System V, Morgan & McGilton, McGraw-Hill 1987.  There is a course packet
from Kinkos.  The course packet contains required materials.


The course is broken down into four basic sections:

  Part I (4 weeks)      Problem analysis and programming in FORTRAN.
                        Algorithms, control structures, simple data
                        Structures and Input-Output.

  Part II (2 weeks)     Application specific section (Biology/Calculus)

  Part III (2 weeks)    More data structures and Input-Output.
                        Functions and Subroutines.

  Part IV (2 weeks)     Application Specific Section

Parts I and III are taught by the computer science instructor as a common
lecture to both sections in room C104.  Parts II and IV are taught as 
separate sections by the biology (C104) and calculus (C103) instructors.  
The computer science instructor will be available during parts II and 
IV for assistance with the FORTRAN language and other computing questions.

The grades for the class is broken down as follows:

  Computer Science:
  Programming Assignments                        20%
  In-Class Tests (2)                             40%

  Application Area (biology/calculus)            40%

Turning in another person's assignment as your own is NOT allowed and 
if a student turns in a copy of someone else's assignment both students 
will receive a zero for that assignment.

Final Grades will be computed based on the overall average as follows:
    93%     4.0        83%    3.0         73%   2.0
    88%     3.5        78%    2.5         Below 0.0

LBS290F                  HANDING IN PROGRAMS

Programs will be graded as follows:

  20%   Documentation.  Comments are required for your name, program 
        number, and student number.  You must have a general description
        of your program at the beginning of the program.

  20%   Style.  Good variable name, indenting, and the overall readability
        of your program and its output.

  60%   Correctness.  Your program must work and produce the correct output.
        You must choose data so as to test the program completely.

Programs are due at 11:59PM (Just before midnight) on the date indicated
in the syllabus.   Programs are marked off by 10% per day for each day late.

You are to hand in your programs from the computer science portion using 
an electronic grading program.  

The automatic grade program will return your grade to you via E-MAIL.  Make
sure to check the returned message for any errors.

To hand in a program, you must prepare the program and it must be syntax
error free and working correctly.  Your program must have adequate comments. 
The following comments must be in every program:

  Program title
  Program number
  Your name
  Date written
  
The following is an example program:

*
* This program converts degrees F to Celsius
*
* Program 1
*
* Author: Charles Severance
* 
* Written: 01/27/91
*
      REAL F,C
      PRINT *,'ENTER DEGREES F -'
      READ *,F
      C = ( F - 32.0 ) * 5.0 / 9.0
      PRINT *,'DEGREES IN CELSUIS - ',C
      END

To submit your program run the command lbs290-prog and enter the file
name containing your program and program number when you are prompted.

The following is an example:

$ lbs290-prog

Welcome to the program which grades LBS290 programs

Enter file name containing program (i.e. file.f)-assn3.f
Enter the program number-1
