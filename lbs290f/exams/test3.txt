2.  What will the following program print out?


    INTEGER I
    INTEGER J

    DO 10 I=1,3
      PRINT *,'I start ',I
      DO 20 J=1,5,2
        PRINT *,I,J
 20   CONTINUE
      PRINT *,'I end ',I
 10 CONTINUE

3.  Write a program which will open a file called data1.  This file
    will contain one number per line.  For each line in the file 
    the  program should print out the number and the number squared.
    Your program should read an unlimited number of lines from the file
    until end-of-file is reached.

    Example input:         Example output:

    2                      2 4
    6                      6 36
