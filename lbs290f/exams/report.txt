This exam is closed book, closed notes.  There are 4 questions on 5 pages.
This exam is worth 20% of your final grade.  The questions are equally
weighted.  Each is worth 25 points.


1.    Assume the following variables:

      Variable   Contents             Type
      ---------------------------------------
      EMPNO      Employee Number      INTEGER
      RATE       Pay Rate             REAL
      HOURS      Hours worked         REAL
      GROSS      Gross Pay            REAL
      TAXES      Taxes withheld       REAL
      NETPAY     Net Pay              REAL

      Write a print statement and format statement which would print the
      values out in the following columns:

           EMPNO      RATE     HOURS      GROSS     TAXES     NETPAY 


          7       12.50     40.00      500.00    125.00    375.00
   
      123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
      Columns  1         2         3         4         5         6

      Your code must be able to handle real numbers up to 9999.99
      and employee numbers up to 9999.  

      NOTE: The answer to this question is NOT a whole program.  It is
      just two FORTRAN statements.  You do not have to read or calculate
      the values for this question - just print them out in the correct
      format.

2.    The purpose of this program is to print out all of the common factors
      of two numbers.  The common factors are those numbers which can be
      evenly divided into both of the umbers.  If the numbers have no common
      factors print out a message.  Terminate the program when a negative
      number is entered.  At the end of the program print the total number
      of pairs processed and the number of common factors found.
      
      Example execution:
      
         $ a.out
         Welcome to the common factors program written by - Arun Student
      
         ENTER TWO NUMBERS
         16,48
         Common Factors of 16 and 48
          2
          4
          8
         16
         The numbers 16 and 48 have 4 common factors
      
         ENTER TWO NUMBERS
         63,71
         Common Factors of 63 and 71
         These numbers have no common factors
      
         ENTER TWO NUMBERS
         -1,-1
         Thank you for using the common factors program.
         Pairs processed: 2
         Factors found: 4

3.   READ this question carefully.  There are some small differences 
     between this question and the previously assigned program.

     The purpose of this program is to track an inventory of 
     a small business.

     The program will track up to 10 parts with part numbers ranging from 1 
     to 10.

     Each line read by the program is an inventory control record.  The first
     number indicates the type of transaction - 1 Stock 2 Sell.
     The second number is the part number.  The last number is the number
     of parts bought or sold.

     Example input:

      1 2 20  Stocked 20 of part 2
      2 4 5  Sold 5 of part 4

     The program must check for an illegal transaction type.  The program 
     must check for an error in the part number.  The program also
     must also not allow product to be sold if there is none in stock.

     The program will print the ending inventory when CTRL-D is entered.

     Example execution:

      $ a.out
      Enter the inventory control record: 3 0 0 
      
      Error - Illegal transaction type 
      
      Enter the inventory control record: 1 20 90 
      
      Error - Part number 20 too large
      
      Enter the inventory control record: 2 4 5
      
      Error - current inventory of part 4 is 0, cannot sell 5
      
      Enter the inventory control record: 1 2 20
      Enter the inventory control record: 1 4 10
      Enter the inventory control record: 2 2 5
      Enter the inventory control record: (CTRL-D)
      
        PART   COUNT

      Thank you for using the inventory program.

Answer to question 3.

4.    The purpose of this program is to list the numbers from 1 to 50
      and determine if each number is prime or composite.  A composite
      number is a number which can be evenly divisible by another number.
      A prime number is one which cannot be evenly divided by any other
      number.  The program will print out the number of prime numbers and
      the number of composite numbers between 1 and 50.
      
      Example output:
      
          NUMBER     TYPE
          ------     ----
              1      PRIME
              2      PRIME
              3      PRIME
              4      COMPOSITE
              5      PRIME
      
          TOTAL PRIME NUMBERS: 14
          TOTAL COMPOSITE NUMBERS: 36
