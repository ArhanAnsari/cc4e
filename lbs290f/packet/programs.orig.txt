The purpose of this program is to print out all of the factors of a
number.  (From EXAM)

Mean, standard deviation from the book.

The purpose of this program is to print out a table of the factorials
of the numbers from 1 to 20.  The factorial of a number is defined as
the product f all numbers from 1 to the number.  The factorial of 4
is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 or 24.  The output of the program should look as
follows:

        NUMBER        FACTORIAL
        ------        ---------
          1              1
          2              2
          3              6
          4             24

The purpose of this program is to repeatedly prompt the user for
numbers.  For each number calculate the factorial of the number and
print it out.  Use the program (or write another program) and find the
largest number for which the factorial can be computed on the system.
Add code to the program to check to see if the number is too large and
print out a message rather than computing the factorial for numbers
for which the factorial can be computed.  The program should terminate
either when a negative number is entered or end of file.

Example execution:

   $ a.out
   Welcome to the factorial program written by Jane Student

   ENTER A NUMBER
   4
   The factorial of 4 is 24

   ENTER A NUMBER
   1000
   The factorial of 1000 cannot be computed on this computer
   Please select a smaller number.

   ENTER A NUMBER
   -1
   Thank you for using the factorial program

The purpose of this program is to print out all of the common factors
of two numbers.  The common factors are those numbers which can be
evenly divided into both of the umbers.  If the numbers have no common
factors print out a message.  Terminate the program when a negative
number is entered.  At the end of the program print the total number
of pairs processed and the number of common factors found.

Example execution:

   $ a.out
   Welcome to the common factors program written by - Arun Student

   ENTER TWO NUMBERS
   16,48
   Common Factors of 16 and 48
    2
    4
    8
   16
   The numbers 16 and 48 have 4 common factors

   ENTER TWO NUMBERS
   63,71
   Common Factors of 63 and 71
   These numbers have no common factors

   ENTER TWO NUMBERS
   -1,-1
   Thank you for using the common factors program.
   Pairs processed: 2

The purpose of this program is to list the numbers from 1 to 50
and determine if each number is prime or composite.  A composite
number is a number which can be evenly divisible by another number.
A prime number is one which cannot be evenly divided by any other
number.  The program will print out the number of prime numbers and
the number of composite numbers between 1 and 50.

Example output:

    NUMBER     TYPE
    ------     ----
        1      PRIME
        2      PRIME
        3      PRIME
        4      COMPOSITE
        5      PRIME

    TOTAL PRIME NUMBERS: 14
    TOTAL COMPOSITE NUMBERS: 36



The purpose of this program is to list the numbers from 1 to 50
and determine if each number is prime or composite.  A composite
number is a number which can be evenly divisible by another number.
A prime number is one which cannot be evenly divided by any other
number.  The program will print out the number of prime numbers and
the number of composite numbers between 1 and 50.  Write a function
which will determine if a given number is prime.  The function should
be integer.  It should return 0 for prime and 1 for composite. The
function header would be as follows:

     FUNCTION ISPRIME(N)
     INTEGER ISPRIME,N

The function call would be as follows:

     IF ( ISPRIME(K).EQ.0 ) THEN
        PRINT *,K,' is a prime number'
     ELSE
        PRINT *,K,' is a composite number'
     ENDIF

Example output:

    NUMBER     TYPE
    ------     ----
        1      PRIME
        2      PRIME
        3      PRIME
        4      COMPOSITE
        5      PRIME

    TOTAL PRIME NUMBERS: 14
    TOTAL COMPOSITE NUMBERS: 36

The purpose of this program is to print the fibonacci numbers from 1
to 50.  The definition of the fibonacci number for a particular number
is defined on the two previous fibonacci numbers.  Fibonacci numbers
are defined as follows:

     FIB(1) = 1
     FIB(2) = 1
     FIB(3) = FIB(2) + FIB(1) = 3
     FIB(4) = FIB(3) + FIB(2) = 4
     FIB(5) = FIB(4) + FIB(3) = 7

Write a program which will print the fibonacci numbers from 1 to 20.

Example output:

     FIB(1) = 1
     FIB(2) = 1
     FIB(3) = 3
     FIB(4) = 4
     FIB(5) = 7

Write a program which will print the value for the function Y = X ** 2
in the range -2 <= X <= 2 at increments of 0.1.  Example output:

      X VALUE       X ** 2
      -------       ------
        -2.0         4.00
        -1.9         3.61

Write a program which will print the value for the function

           3      2
      Y = X  + 2 X  - X  - 2

in the range -3 <= X <=3 at increments of 0.1.


Write a program which will evaluate the function

           3      2
      Y = X  + 2 X  - X  - 2

in the range -3 <= X <=3 at increments of 0.1 and print the highest
and lowest point of the function in that range.  Also print all the
points where the absolute value of the function is less than 0.1.
Do the same exercise with increment of 0.01 and 0.3.  Example output:

Write a program which will compute a student's final grade based on
a percentage for programs, tests, and projects.  The grade is broken
down as follows:

       Programs    30%
       Tests       45%
       Projects    25%

The program will prompt for the student number and percentage (out of
100%) for each of the areas.  The program will compute an overall
percentage for the course and assign a grade using the following
scale:

      Percentage   Grade

      > 95.0        4.0
      > 90.0        3.5
      > 85.0        3.0
      > 80.0        2.5
      > 75.0        2.0
      < 75.0        0.0

Example run:

    $ a.out
    Enter student number
    123456
    Enter percentage for programs
    0.95
    Enter percentage for tests
    0.70
    Enter percentage for projects
