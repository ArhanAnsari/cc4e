LBS290                    GETTING HELP (USING SCRIPT)

When you are having trouble getting your program to compile or execute
you may need to get help from the instructor or teaching assistant.

You can make best use of your time if you bring printed information
showing exactly what is going wrong.  To do this you use a program
called script which records everything that is being sent to the screen on 
a file which can then be printed on the printer and carried to the 
instructor or TA.

To use script you simply type

  script filename

Then execute your program causing the problem. When finished, type exit
to terminate the script and you can print out the file containing your session.
With a little experimenting you will find this to be a useful tool.

Example use of script:

$ fort dowhile.f
File dowhile.f:
    MAIN:
	dowhile.f(12):	Missing closing quote
	dowhile.f(29):	Syntax error: "END" followed by "left-hand-side":

2 errors diagnosed in file dowhile.f

$ ce dowhile.f

 ---- Try to figure out the errors ---

$ fort dowhile.f
File dowhile.f:
    MAIN:
	dowhile.f(12):	Missing closing quote
	dowhile.f(29):	Syntax error: "END" followed by "left-hand-side":

2 errors diagnosed in file dowhile.f

 ---- Still unable to figure things out ---

$ script scrfile      (Record everything in the file scrfile )
Recording...
Exit shell to stop
