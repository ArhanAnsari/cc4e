                        ASSIGNMENT 5 - Fibonacci Numbers

Due Date: April 13, 1992 11:59PM

The purpose of this program is to print the Fibonacci numbers from 1
to 50.  The definition of the Fibonacci number for a particular number
is defined on the two previous Fibonacci numbers.  Fibonacci numbers
are defined as follows:

     FIB(1) = 1
     FIB(2) = 1
     FIB(3) = FIB(2) + FIB(1) = 3
     FIB(4) = FIB(3) + FIB(2) = 4
     FIB(5) = FIB(4) + FIB(3) = 7

Write a program which will print the Fibonacci numbers from 1 to 20.

Example output:

     Fibonacci numbers from 1 to 20 - written by Hal Student

     FIB(1) = 1
     FIB(2) = 1
     FIB(3) = 3
     FIB(4) = 4
     FIB(5) = 7
