                  ASSIGNMENT 13 - Payroll Using Subroutines

Due Date: May 4, 1992 11:59 PM

The purpose of this program is to use subroutines.

In this program you will perform exactly the same as program 9.  However
in this program you must write and call a subroutine to calculate the
gross pay, and taxes for the employee.

The subroutine should be named CALCPAY.  The header for the subroutine
should be as follows:

      SUBROUTINE CALCPAY(GP,TAXES,RATE,HOURS)
      REAL GP,RATE,HOURS

The input and output for the program are the same as program 9.
