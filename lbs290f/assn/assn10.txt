                        ASSIGNMENT 10 - Inventory Program

Due Date: April 27, 1992 11:59 PM

The purpose of this program is to track an inventory of a small business.

The program will track up to 10 parts with part numbers ranging from 1 
to 10.

Each line read by the program is an inventory control record.  The first
number indicates the type of transaction - 1 Stock 2 Sell 3 List.
The second number is the part number.  The last number is the number
of parts bought or sold for type 1 or 2 records.

Example input:

1 2 20  Stocked 20 of part 2
2 4 5  Sold 5 of part 4
3 0 0  List the current inventory

The program must check for an illegal transaction type.  The program 
must check for an error in the part number.  The program also
must also not allow product to be sold if there is none in stock.

Example execution:

$ a.out
Enter the inventory control record: 6 0 0 

Error - Illegal transaction type 6, please enter number between 1 and 3

Enter the inventory control record: 1 20 90
