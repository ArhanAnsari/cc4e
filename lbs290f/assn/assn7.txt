Due Date: April 17, 1992 11:59PM

The purpose of this program is to print out a table of the factorials
of the numbers from 1 to 20.  The factorial of a number is defined as
the product f all numbers from 1 to the number.  The factorial of 4
is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 or 24.  The output of the program should look as
follows:

        NUMBER        FACTORIAL
        ------        ---------
          1              1
          2              2
          3              6
          4             24
