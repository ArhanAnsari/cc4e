                        ASSIGNMENT 4 - A Smarter Quadratic

Due Date: April 10, 1992 11:59PM

The purpose of this program is to compute the roots of a polynomial
using the quadratic formula.

This formula solves for the value of x in a polynomial of the form:
     
           2
       a x    +   b  x   +  c  = 0

 
is:

                     2
         - b  +     b   - 4ac
x  =    --------------------- 
                  2a

and

                     2
         - b  -     b   - 4ac
x  =    --------------------- 
                  2a

Write a program which prompts for the the values of a, b, and c.
and calculate the roots of a quadratic formula.

The program must check to see that the determinant:

                   2
  determinant  =  b  - 4ac

Is greater than or equal zero before calculating the square root.  This will
keep the program from getting a domain error.

When the program has a negative determinant, it should print out:

Negative determinant - no roots found

In this program it IS wrong to blow up with a domain error.

Example executions:

  $ a.out
  Enter the value for a: 1.0
  Enter the value for b: -3.0
  Enter the value for c: 2.0

  First root: 2.0
  Second root: 1.0

  $ a.out
  Enter the value for a: 1.0
  Enter the value for b: 2.0
  Enter the value for c: 8.0

  Negative determinant - no roots found
