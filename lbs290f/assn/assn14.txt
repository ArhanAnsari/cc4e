             ASSIGNMENT 14 - Finding Max, Min, Mean, Mean and Sort Again

Due Date: May 6, 1992 11:59 PM

The purpose of this program is to use functions and subroutines.

In this program you will read in an array of up to 20 numbers.

You will write and call the following functions:

   REAL FUNCTION FINDMAX(ARR,N)
   REAL ARR(20)
   INTEGER N

   REAL FUNCTION FINDMIN(ARR,N)
   REAL ARR(20)
   INTEGER N

   REAL FUNCTION CALCMEAN(ARR,N)
   REAL ARR(20)
   INTEGER N

   SUBROUTINE SORTNUM(ARR,N)
   REAL ARR(20)
   INTEGER N

You must use these functions to calculate the max, min, and mean of 
the numbers.    The main program should print out the max, mean, and
min of the numbers.  After the main program has done these calculations
it should call your subroutine to sort the numbers.  After the
subroutine returns, the main program should print out the sorted 
numbers.
