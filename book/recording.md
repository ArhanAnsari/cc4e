Welcome to C Programming for Everybody. My name is Charles Severance and
this my a reading of of the 1978 "The C Programming Language" book written by Brian W. 
Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.  At times, I add my own interpretation
of the material to place it in a historical perspective.

This is a recording of Chapter 0 the 1978 "The C Programming Language" book written
by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.  This recording is part of
my C Programming for Everybody course where I teach C and computer
architecture from a historical perspective.  My name is Charles R.
Severance and I am the teacher of this course.
