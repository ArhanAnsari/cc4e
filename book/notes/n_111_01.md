Back in 1978, the two largest bodies of C code were likely the AT&T UNIX kernel and UNIX utilities like `grep`, `ls`, or
the login shell. So writing an operating system was fresh on the mind of the authors while writing this book.  These topics
find their way into the text of the book.

In a sense, a likely second-order goal of the book was to train programmers that might
learn C and then help build and maintain UNIX.  The 1978 edition of this textbook fits nicely into a series of
AT&T Bell Labs technical reports like "Portability of C Programs and the UNIX System" written
by Steven C. Johnson and Dennis M . Ritchie, published in
The Bell System Technical Journal, Vol. 57, No. 6, Part 2, July-August 1978, pp 2021-2048.
