We see another reference to the fact that the number of bits in the `int` type is
in transition in 1978.   The older PDP-11 used a 16-bit integer to save limited memory
while later computers from IBM and Honeywell have already switched to
an `int` type that is 32-bits.  This allowed code originally written for a PDP/11
like UNIX or even the C compiler to be recompiled on an IBM or Honeywell with
very few changes.
