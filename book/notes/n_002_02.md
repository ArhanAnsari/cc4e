Before UNIX and C, if you were running the vendor operating system and writing in the best language for systems
like the PDP/11 and Interdata 7/32 - the user experience was *completely* different.  Today we take for granted that
expect to be able to download the same application for a Windows, MacOS, or a Linux system.  Even in the 1970's
those that were using UNIX and C could write code once and move it between two hardware platforms and expect that
it would work with not or relatively few changes.
