Here in Chapter 1, we have changed the book's original use of a function named
`getline()` to `get_line()`  in code examples, because it conflicts with the
`stdio.h` file that defines `getline()` as a library function.  In this
chapter, the authors are providing examples around
function naming and linking.  In later chapters, code samples will use the
built-in `getline()` to read a line of input.
