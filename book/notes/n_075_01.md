This example code above shows why it is important to remember the "K&R C Rearrangement License" as it applies to
operators that are associative and commutative.  If the code for the '-' operator above were written:

    push(pop() - pop());

There is no guarantee the the left `pop()` will run before the right `pop()` - and since these functions
access global variables and have side effects it is important to force the compiler not to rearrange the
order of the function calls.

To force the evaluation order the code is broken into two statements:

    op2 = pop();
    push(pop() - op2);

Now you might think that the lesson is that the "K&R C Rearrangement License" (which was done to
allow optimization and performance) is a bad idea.  But the more important lesson
is that writing low-level utility functions like `push` and `pop` which use global variables
and have side effects is a dangerous pattern in any language.
