Once again, the authors are making the case that the syntax of the language should
not include syntax for Input/Output operations but instead call library functions.

Keeping the compiler small and easy to port to new systems was important.  And even if something
like `putchar` was part of the language syntax, it would be translated at run-time
to call a function.

Programming languages from the 1960's tended to have a very small set of use cases - read some input,
run some calculations, and write to files - so it seemed like a few language elements would be sufficient
to describe all programs.  But as programs started to make network connections, draw buttons on a screen,
and respond to API calls over the network - it would have been difficult to keep expanding core language syntax
for each new use case.  But it was natural to add new libraries with functions to
call to accomplish these new use cases.
