With these words, the authors triggered a "great debate" about how to best indent code
and use braces that continues to this day.  The indentation style style used in this book
is often referred to as "K&R style".  It tends to put open braces at the end of statements
like `if` and `while` to keep code more compact in terms of number of lines of code.

The best advice is not to debate at all. When you modify someone else's code imitate
the existing style of code.
