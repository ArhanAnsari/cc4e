Formatted output is difficult.  The design of C `printf`
was inspired by the earlier FORMAT statement in FORTRAN and ALGOL.  In order
to compete with these languages, C needed to ship with solid support 
for formatted output.

The approach chosen by C percolated into C-like languages. PHP and Java
simply have a function called `printf()` that supported most of the C
formats.

Python has evolved its approach to formatted output over the years.
An early solution had a syntax that used `%` to provide C-like formatting.
There was also a `format()` method on the string object:

    x = 421.34
    print("x is %7.2f" % (x,))
    print("x is {y:7.2f}".format(y=x))

The latest (and least clunky) way to do this in Python is "F-strings":

    print(f"x is {x:7.2f}")

But even after all this evolution much of this output formatting traces its
design inspiration from C's `printf()` capabilities.
