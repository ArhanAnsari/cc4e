The `||` and `&&` are the norm for boolean operators in "C-like" languages.
When a new language was being designed, it was easy to adopt the C conventions for logical operators
because, while they are cryptic, millions of software developers already were familiar
with the operators.  In this way, the relationship between C and C-like languages is like 
the relationship between Latin and the Romance languages including English.
