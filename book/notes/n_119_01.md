While we talk about "data structures", and how to use them in every language, this section
is about understanding how software developers carefully control the low-level "shape" of their data
items to solve their problems.

When you first learn about the C `struct` keyword, you might think that it is equivalent to
a Python `dict` - a dynamic key-value store like a PHP array, Java map,
or JavaScript object - but nothing is further from the truth.  These
other languages provide us with easy-to use data structures where all of the
challenging problems are solved.

This chapter tells the creators of Python, PHP, Java, and JavaScript *how* to solve the complex problems and
build convienent and flexible data structures which we use in all of those object-oriented languages.

One way to look at the code in this chapter is to think of it as a lesson on how one might
build Python's `list` and `dict` data structures.
