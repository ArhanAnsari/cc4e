The next two sections do a great job of covering file input and the notion of the "standard
error" nicely with very simple sample code.  But the authors are also making a very subtle
point about UNIX and how the design of UNIX makes it very easy to build UNIX utilities.

By the end of section 7.6, we see a 29 program that is a pretty much complete implementation
of the core functionality of the UNIX `cat` command.  Part of the philosophy of UNIX was to build
commands that are each simple building blocks that can be composed using input and output
redirection as well as pipes.

These next two sections are a celebration of the design principles that underly the UNIX operating
