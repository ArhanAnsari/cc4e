One reason the authors make vague forward-looking statements whenever they talk about dynamic memory is that
large-scale memory management in a programming language is still a subject of active research 40 years later.  Back in
1978 it was absolutely not a settled topic.

You can see this when the authors build a simple non-production memory allocation scheme with their own `alloc()` and `free()`
routines backed by a fixed length `static extern` array of characters.   Dynamic allocation is essential to writing competent C
programs, but it is likely that production grade dynamic memory support was still somewhat non-portable when the book was written - so
they used simple self-contained implementations in this book.

Modern dynamic memory support is through the `malloc()`, `calloc()` and `free()` functions in the standard library.  These functions
request dynamic memory blocks from the operating system and manage those areas on behalf of your C code.  On UNIX and UNIX-like systems
the memory allocation layer asks the underlying operating system for blocks of memory through the
[sbrk()](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sbrk) interface.

Even with virtual memory, programmers must carefully manage their use of dynamically allocated memory because memory is never unlimited.
