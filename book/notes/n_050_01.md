The real moral of the story is to use side effect operators very carefully.  They are generally only used in idiomatic situations
and then wrtten using simple code.   The authors are happy to tell you everything that you *can* do in C in great deal and they are
also suggesting that just because you *can* do something that it does not mean you *should* do something.  Remember that a key aspect
of writing programs is to communicate with future human readers of your code.

With modern-day compilers and optimizers, you gain little performance by writing dense / obtuse code.   Write the code
and describe what you want done and let the compiler find the best way to do it.
One of the reasons that a common senior project in many Computer Science degrees was to write a complier is to make sure
all Computer Science students understand that they can trust the compiler to generate great code.
