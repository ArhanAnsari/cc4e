In general, rectangular multi-dimensional arrays are used in computational programs like
a weather simulation and were a way (back in the day) to write C code that could accept
FORTRAN multi-dimensional arrays as parameters so that computational or statistical
libraries could be written in C.

Arrays of pointers are a better mapping to the typical operating system and string manipulation
use cases that is more the core of C applications.   We also call these "ragged arrays"
because each row can be a different length.   This also works well as data is dynamically
allocated in C - as compared to the more typical static allocation in FORTRAN's multi-dimensional
arrays.
