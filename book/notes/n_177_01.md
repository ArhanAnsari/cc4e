Dynamic memory is hard.  Modern languages like Python, Ruby, and Java give us high level objects like
strings, lists, and dictionaries.   These structures automatically expand and contract, can be copied into
a temporary variable and used and then discarded.

Modern languages depend on efficient memory allocation. A problem when dynamic memory is heavily used is
the fragmentation of the free space.   You can get to the point where you have plenty of memory but each of the free memory areas is so small that you can't allocate a new memory block.

When this happens, the run-time implementations of these systems run a step call "garbage collection" where
everything pauses and free areas are moved around to make sure that the free memory is in a few large
contiguous areas rather than many small non-contiguous areas.

Language developers have been improving garbage collection algorithms for the past 40 years and there is
still much work to do.
