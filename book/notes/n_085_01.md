Ah recursion.  Recursion is a beloved concept in Computer Science.  It is often taught early in most programming 
courses because it is "so cool".   Most examples like computing factorial or the example above of converting a
an integer to a string are not good uses of recursion.

But when you need ot traverse a tree-based structure like an XML document, or parse a mathematical expression,
recursion is the ideal solution.  So the problem is not recursion, but when it is taught and what examples are used.
