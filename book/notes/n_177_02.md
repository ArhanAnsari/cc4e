Now that the authors have established all the reasons that make C the ideal portable
systems programming language (which I heartily agree with), it is time to talk about
where C comes up short as a general purpose language for those of us not working on
the source code to Linux.

The most challenging aspect of C is the lack of dynamic structures that we can use
without the need to carefully allocate, use without regard to the length of the allocated
dynamic memory, and not worry about calling `cfree()` *every single time* we call
`calloc()`.

If a programmer without strong programming skills, a good understanding of a testing
regimen, and a proper defensive programming attitude is let loose in C - they will
invariable write poor code.   Their C code will make poor use of resources, run the system
out of memory, or produce code that is riddled with security holes and bugs that seem
to randomly appear.

A decade after C emerged and became popular, Guido van Rossum designed a language called
Python.  It was one of a number of languages that was built using C, and added an object-oriented
layer greatly simplified writing programs that used dynamic memory, and added "guard rails"
so programmers did not unintentionally write dangerous, or insecure code.

The key value-add features that make Python more appropriate for general purpose programming are
the string object, `list` object, `dict` object that handle all the aspects creating and using
variables and collections of variables.
