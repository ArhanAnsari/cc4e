Bitwise operators may seem unnecessary for modern computers, but if you look at tthe internal structure
of TCP/IP packets, values are packed very tightly into the headers in order to save space.  C made it possible to write
portable TCP/IP implementations on a wide range of hardware architectures.

Bitwise operators also play an important role in encryption, decription, and checksum calculations.   Modern languages like
`Java` and `Python` support bitwise operators following the same patterns that we established in C so things like TCP/IP
and encryption algorithms can also be implemented in these languages.

By defining these operators, it kept software developers from needing to write non-portable assembly language code
to implement these low-level features in operating systems and libraries.
