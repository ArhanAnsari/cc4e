The above paragraph allowing the compiler to reorder computations even in the presense of parenthesis
is known as the "K&R C Rearrangement License".  As the author's state, it almost never makes a difference
unless an expression contains a value computed in a function call or there is a pointer lookup to find a value
for the computation that might fail.  This rule was subtly adjusted in the ISO version of C but ISO C still does
does not strictly force the order of otherwise commutative operations - even in the presense of parenthesis.

The good news is that as long as you keep your expressions simple, you don't have to worry about this rule.
Sometimes the real value of parenthesis is to communicate your intentions to human readers of your code.
If you are writing code that depends of the order of overflow, fuction calls, and pointer dereferences in a single
mathematical expression - perhaps you *should* break your expression into multiple statements.
