Once again, we see C and UNIX straddling a major improvement in computer hardware in 1978.
The natural name for a function to randomly move around in a file would be `seek()`.  But
in rearly versions of UNIX, `seek()` took an integer as the offset.   But on small-word
computers like PDP-11 have an integer that cannot represent a number larger than 65535.
So `seek()` used a complex set of rules to handle larger files.

The only logical thing to do was to have the offset be a `long` - hence the name
`lseek()` that we use to this day.   In modern C, `seek()` has just faded away and
we all just call `lseek()` and pass it a `long`.
