Once again, we see C and UNIX straddling a major improvement in computer hardware in 1978.
The natural name for a function to randomly move around in a file would be `seek()`.  But
in early versions of UNIX, `seek()` took an integer as the offset.   But on small-word
computers like PDP-11 have an integer that cannot represent a number larger than 65535.
So `seek()` used a complex set of rules to handle larger files.

The only logical thing to do was to have the offset be a `long` and for upwards compatibility
make a new function named `lseek()` that we use to this day.
