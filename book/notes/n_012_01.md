The syntax of the `for` and `while` loops is a feature of C-like languages.  In modern languages
we tend to have two kinds of loop structures - determinant and indeterminant.  The `for` and `while`
loop structures are indeterminate because you must read them closely to make sure they are
properly constructed and, for example, are not unintentionaly "infinite loops".

An example of a determinant loop is the `foreach` loop in PHP or `for` loop in Python.  The semantics of 
both of these loops is to iterate over all of the elements in a collection.  Because the collections
are not infinite, you can be assured that these determinant loops will not run forever.
