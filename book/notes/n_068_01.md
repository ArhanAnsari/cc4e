This `cc` example does not quite work as described above in modern C compilers.  If you want the
compile to leave the compiled object code around after the compile, you can add
the "-c" option to the compiler call.  Modern C compilers generally do accept multiple files with either ".c" or
".o" suffixes and combine then into a runnable application.
