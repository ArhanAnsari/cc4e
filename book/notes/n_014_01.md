Modern C compilers define `EOF` in the `stdio.h` include file - so you should never
define `EOF` in your code.  In modern C, the value of `EOF` is -1, but you should just
include `stdio.h` and use the pre-defined `EOF` constant to check for end of file.

The "nuisance" of different values for `EOF` was resolved shortly after 1978.
