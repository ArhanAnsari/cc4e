Modern C compilers define `EOF` in the `stdio.h` include file - so you should never
define `EOF` in your code.  The actual value of `EOF` is -1, but you should just
include `stdio.h` and use the `EOF` constant to check for end of file.

The "nusiance" of different values for `EOF` was resolved shortly after 1978.
