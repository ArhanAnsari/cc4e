The balance between building a feature into the language itself and providing it as a function
in a library is something that computer language designers struggle with many years later.
For example, in Python 2, `print` was a language element.  In Python 3, one of the non-upwards compatible
and somewhat unpopular changes
was changing `print()` to be a function.  Many programmers feel that a `print` statement
is a more elegant way to express printing, but from a compiler and language design perspective a function
call with a variable number of parameters is seen as technically more elegant and flexible.

With Kernighan and Ritchie focused on keeping everything small and portable they opted to keep 
all input / output (I/O) functionality in libraries.  The syntax is a little more complex - but it is
the more elegant solution.
