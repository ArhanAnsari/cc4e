Separating the "checking for things that *might* be wrong" into the `lint` program keeps the C compiler simple
and easy to port to a new computer.  The `lint` program was naturally a very portable text-processing
application.   While there is some initial overlap between a `lint` program and a compiler,
over time, there is quite distinct research and expertise in "how to lint" versus "how to compile".
Modern `lint` programs look at programs in far more detail than most compilers.  Separating
the concerns of `lint` and the C compiler, also allowed `lint` programs to use more
memory, and take more time to execute than compilers.  Since the typical developer might
use the compiler many times per day and run `lint` less often it was nice for the compiler
to run quickly and make light use of computer resources.
