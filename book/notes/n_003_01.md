Separating the "checking for things that *might* be wrong" into the `lint` program keeps the C compiler simple
and easy to port to a new computer.  The `lint` program was naturally a portable text-processing
application.   While there is some initial overlap between a `lint` program and a compiler,
over time, there is quite distinct research and expertise in "how to lint" versus "how to compile".
Modern `lint` programs look at programs in far more detail than most compilers.  Separating
the concerns of `lint` and the C compiler, also allowed `lint` programs to use more
memory, and take more time to execute than compilers.  Since the typical developer might
use the compiler many times per day and run `lint` less often it was nice for the compiler
to run quickly and make light use of computer resources.

We call this idea of building two smaller programs that each specialize in one task, "separation of concerns" and
it is an important principle in Computer Science.  By keeping each component simple and focused, we can more easily build,
test, and verify each component. UNIX and C showed the benefits of taking a "many small components" approach to solve
an overall set of problems.
