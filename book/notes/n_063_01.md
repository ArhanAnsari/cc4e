Before we leave control flow, I need to say that I agree with structured programming experts as well as Kernighan and Ritchie in
that using `goto` is universally a bad idea.  There is a lot of little details that make them a real problem - things like how the stack
works in function calls and code blocks and patching the stack up correctly when a `goto` happens is a mess.

You might be tempted to use a `goto` when you want to exit multiple nested loops in a single statement (`break` and `continue` only
exit the innermost loop).  The authors use this as an example above but are quite lukewarm when describing the use of `goto`.

Usually if your problem is that complex putting things in a function and using `return`, or adding a few `if` statements is a better
choice.  The Dr. Chuck middle tested loop solves this because the loop is always the innermost loop.

Also as new languages were built the concept of "exceptions" became part of language design and was a far more elegant solution to
a path of of some deeply nested code that just needs to "get out".  So most of the time you think `goto` is a good idea - you should
lean towards a `throw` / `catch` pattern to make your intention clear.  It is one of the reasons why we prefer languages like Java
or Python over C when writing general purpose code.
