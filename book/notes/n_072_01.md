Interestingly modern languages like Python, PHP, and Java go to great lengths to make variable length argument lists
work predictably and portably in those languages.  The syntax for variable length argument lists in these languages
can be a bit obtuse at times - but at least it is allowed, documented, reliable, and portable.
