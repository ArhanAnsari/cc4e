The primary difference between C and C-influenced languages like Java, PHP, and
JavaScript, is that in C strings are character arrays while in the other 
languages, strings are "objects".

These string objects do have an array of the actual bytes / characters - but
they also keep track of the length of a string and provide functionality like
"extract a substring" in methods in those objects.

In C, there is a set of library functions that perform string operations like
"compare two strings" while string comparison is built into the string
objects in each language.

Strings as character arrays allows programmers to build very fast, low level
code in libraries and operating systems.  But to write the code well, you need
to understand what is really going on at the low level.
