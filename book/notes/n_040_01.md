Since the book was written before the `getchar` function was standardized, the text is somewhat vague in this section.  Shortly after
the book was published, `getchar` was put into the `stdio.h` and declared to return an integer so as to accommodate all possible 
characters and the integer `-1` value to indicate end of file.

The above code would be better written with `c` as an integer:

    int c;

    c = getchar();
    if (c == EOF) ...

While the conversion from `char` to `int` may or may not have sign extension (and yes it still depends on the implementation
50 years later), the conversion from `int` to `char` is predictable with the top bits simply being discarded.

If you are using the library function `gets` to read a file line-by-line, we don't need to worry about this conversion.  Since `gets`
returns a pointer to a character array (i.e. a string) - it indicates it has reached end-of-file by returning a "null" pointer (i.e.
there is no more data to give).
