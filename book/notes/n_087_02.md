Here at the end of Chapter 4, it is a good time to talk about the word "address".  Up to this
point in the book, the word "address" has been used ten times without a precise definition beyond the
notion that data is stored in memory and the "address" of the data is *where* the data is stored
in the memory.

In the next chapter, this notion of "the address of where the data is stored" becomes very
real and tangible as we explore "pointers" as well the `&` and `*` operators.

Up to now, an experienced JavaScript, PHP or Java programmer can view C
as "just another set of syntax rules" with a few quirky run-time bits.  But in the
next chapter we will deeply explore the concept of data allocation and location.

It turns out that every programming language pays a lot of attention to data allocation and location,
but the run-time environments of modern languages work very hard not to expose you to those details.
Just because modern languages hide the "difficult bits" from us, it does not mean that those languages
solve the problem using "magic" - eventually the problem needs to be solved.

And that is why the compilers and low-level run-time elements of languages like PHP, JavaScript, and Java
are usually written in C.  So the builders of those languages
can solve difficult data storage and allocation problems for you.
