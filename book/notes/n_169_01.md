The sample code in this section shows how we can write applications like `ls` to
interact with directories in a UNIX filesystem.  However the code in this section
is not portable to modern UNIX systems so we will leave the code as it is in this
section.  It is good to read this code and get an *outline* of how to work with
directories on UNIX.  If you want to write code to handle directories you will need
to consult more modern documentation.
