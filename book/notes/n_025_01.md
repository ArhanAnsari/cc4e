Be careful looking at the code samples in the rest of this chapter.
Recall that in C array sizes do not grow and shrink dynamically after they are allocated.
The authors statically allocate character arrays
capable of handling lines up to 1000 characters long.
Their code works, but it is somewhat brittle.

So look at the next two sections as examples of C-syntax
with many important concepts about character strings stored as arrays
and calling patterns when passing arrays to functions as parameters,
but not exactly best practice when handling dynamically sized data.
