Ah hashing functions.

Hashing functions are one of the foundational
notions in Computer Science.  Hashing functions are used for everything from high-performance in-memory structures,
organizing data in databases, digital signing, network packet checksums, security algorithms and much more.

The above text is a great example of a really simple hashing function. You should understand this simple
presentation well so that when you encounter a more complex implementation or use of hashing, you can fall back on this text
to understand that at its core hashing is a very simple concept.

So much of this chapter is a succinct example of some of the most powerful concepts in Computer Science.
Please don't look at eight lines of code above and think "I got that" and jump to the next bit.
This chapter is showing you the way of the master programmer.
Be patient, slow down,  and enjoy your time here.
