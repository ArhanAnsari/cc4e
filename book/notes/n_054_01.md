Note that in the above examples, the `else` and the `if` are two language constructs that are just being used
idiomatically to construct an `else if` pattern with indentation that captures the idiom.

If we are pedantic about indentation of the above sequence we would be separating the
`else` and `if` and then indenting each succeeding block further as follows
(brackets added for clarity):

    if (expression) {
        statement
    }
    else 
    {
        if (expression) {
            statement
        }
        else 
        {
            if (expression) {
                statement
            }
            else
            {
                statement
            }
        }
    }

Java and JavaScript keep the `else` and `if` as separate language elements and document their
idiomatic usage and indentation just like C.

But the Python `elif` is a new language construct that achieves the same end as shown below:

    if (expression) :
        block
    elif (expression) :
        block
    elif (expression) :
        block
    else :
        block

The C/Java/JavaScript and Python idioms thankfully look the same when the idiomatic indentation
is used.  Even FORTRAN 77 supports the `ELSE IF` construct.
