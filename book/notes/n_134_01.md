The concerns the authors mention in this section are also nicely resolved in modern C compilers.  In the ANSI
standard version of C, they introduced the notion of the 
[void type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_type).
The `void` type indicates the "lack of" a type - much like `NULL` is used to
indicate "not a valid pointer".  In 1978 because the `char` type was
generally the most native type on any system, it was used when a generic pointer needed to be returned
from a memory allocation function.  In modern C we use pointers to `void` and then cast the
returned pointer to be a pointer to whatever `struct` or other data we just allocated.

If we were writing the `alloc()` routine in this book using modern C, it would return a pointer to a void

    char *alloc(n) /* 1978 version */
    int n;
    { ... }

    void *alloc(n) /* Modern version */
    int n;
    { ... }

It is a testimate to the foresight of the authors all of the pointer casting code in this book works
the same *regardless* of whether memory allocation functions return `char` or `void` pointers to the allocated
data.
