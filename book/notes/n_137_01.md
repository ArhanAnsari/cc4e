Now we are going to go from low-level programming to even-lower-level
programming.  The UNIX operating system is written in C and UNIX needs
to have an implementation of the Internet protocols so it can be connected
to the Internet.  One of the most important Internet protocols is
the "Transmission Control Protocol" (TCP).

In order to implement TCP, you need to send very precisely formatted data.
This data is very tightly packed in order to save precious network bandwidth.
The exact format of a TCP header is described in the 
[TCP Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol).
If you look at the header, you will find that at bits 96-99 in the header, TCP expects
a four bit integer that defines the "data offset".

Exactly what this data means is less relevant unless you are writing the actual TCP
implementation - but it does demonstrate that we need control of our data layout
on a bit by bit basis.

This section covers how we can use `struct` to build up a TCP header in C which can be parsed
and set without using masking and shifting operators with hard-coded numbers.

The section below is simpler than constructing a valid TCP header using a carefully packed
`struct`, but it lays the groundwork for these more complicated situations.
