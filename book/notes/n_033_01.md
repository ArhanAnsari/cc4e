In modern C languages, the limitation of the first eight characters of a variable name being unique has been extended.
In most C variants to be at least 30 characters of a variable name are treated as unique.
The eight character limitation was to reflect a typical limitation of identifier length
in assembly language programming and run-time linkers of the time.
