This description of the details of the implementation of the `register` modifier
on the PDP/11 is a delightful peek into how that C compiler generated run-time code.

As compilers became more sophisticated, they could decide which variables to keep in
registers better than the programmer could. And since register allocation to variables
might be different on different hardware architectures, the `register` indication is generally
ignored by modern C compilers.
