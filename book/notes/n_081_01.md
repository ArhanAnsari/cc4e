This description of the details of the implementation of the `register` modifier
on the PDP/11 is a delightful peek into how the C compiler generated run-time code on
that system in the mid-1970's.

As compilers became more sophisticated, the compiler could decide which variables to keep in
registers better than the programmer could. And since how variables would be allocated to
registers might be different on different hardware architectures, the `register` indication is generally
ignored by modern C compilers so you should never use it in your code.

As a matter of fact, I wrote the following sample C program and compiled it with the "-S" option
so I could see the generated assembly language with and without the `register` declaration.
There was no difference between the code generated between the two versions of the code.

The reason the generated assembly code was identical regardless of the use of 
the `register` keyword was that the C optimizer (on my ARM-based computer in 2022) realized
that the best way to implement the code was to keep *both* `iter` and `compute` in registers
because the loop code was so simple and the CPU in my computer had plenty of registers and
optimized any loading and storing of the data memory right out of the program.

In 1978, the authors likely included `register` as a feature to convince experienced
assembly language programmers that they should write all but the lowest level code
in C.
