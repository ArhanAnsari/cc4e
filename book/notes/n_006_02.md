On modern systems, we use the `gcc` compiler with the `-ansi` option to 
accept the "legacy" syntax of C:

    gcc -ansi hello.c

To run the resulting `a.out` file, usually you need to pre-pend the local directory because
most shell configurations do not include the current path in the paths to search for applications:

    ./a.out
