Ah the `switch` statement.  What is there to say?  I think that the `switch` statement
was added to C to compete with the earlier FORTRAN "computed GOTO" statement or to keep low-level
programmers from switching to assembly language to implement a 
[branch table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_table).

The authors spend most of the previous section apologizing for the `switch` statement, so perhaps
you should take that as a hint and never use it.

There are very few situation where a branch table outperforms a series of if-else checks
and those are likely deep in library or operating system code.  Programmers should only use
`switch` if they understand what a branch table is, and why it is more efficent
for this particular bit of their program.  Otherwise just use `else if` to do the readers
of your code a favor.
