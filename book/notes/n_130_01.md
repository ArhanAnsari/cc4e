Before we start this section, a slightly longer aside from your narrator.  Up to now, I have resisted the 
temptation to augment the book with my own bits of code.   But we have reached the single point in the book 
where I feel that there is too big of a conceptual leap between sections 6.4 and 6.5 so I am going to add
some of my own narrative.

The rest of this chapter talks very nicely about 
[binary trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)
and 
[hash tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) - both essential low level data
structures in Computer Science and both excellent ways to understand pointers and how C can be used to
build data structures like the Python `dict`.  However the authors skipped describing a dynamically constructed
[linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) which is the 
first and foundational collection data structure in Computer Science.

Linked lists form the foundation of the Python `list` object, Java Array object, PHP numeric key arrays,
and JavaScript arrays.   The linked list can be dynamically extended and items can be added in the middle
effiently as well as being pushed or popped on  or off the front or back of the list.  Linked lists also
are used to implement queues as well as other aspects of operating systems.
