This prediction was indeed accurate.  Modern C compilers support the copying of a structure with a single assignment
statement.  Given that a C structure is just a small fixed length block of memory - it is easy to generate machine code to copy it.
A key bit to remember is that when a C structure is copied - it is done as a 
["shallow copy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Shallow_copy).  A shallow copy, copies the *values* of 
the variables and pointers in the structure but does not make copies of any of the data which the pointers point to.
A structure contains other structures (i.e. not pointers to structures), then those structures are shallow copied as well.
