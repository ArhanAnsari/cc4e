Before we start Chapter 5, a quick note from your narrator.  From time to time
I have been adding some of my interpretation to this book.  But I won't be adding
anything to this chapter.  I think that sections 5.1 through 5.6 contain some of
the most elegantly written text in the book.  The concepts are clearly stated
and the example code is short, direct, and easy to understand.  Pointers are the essential
difference between C and any other modern programming languages.  So pay close attention
to this chapter and make sure you understand it before continuing.

This chapter is as strong now as it was in 1978 so without futher ado, we
read and listen as Kernighan and Ritchie teach us about pointers and arrays.
