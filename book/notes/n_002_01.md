In this preface, the authors are justifying the fact that many of the well-established programming languages of
the 1960's and 1970's
like FORTRAN, COBOL, Pascal, Algol, and PL/I were solving many of the use cases that were needed by programmers by adding
syntax to the languages.  The creators of C and UNIX were advocating for a more minimal set of programming language
constructs and more reliance on calling functions in provided run-time libraries to meet programmer use cases.  It may
have seemed a strange approach to experienced programmers in the 1980's, but over time it has allowed C to expande to meet
a very wide range of programmer needs without requiring major revisions to the core language or compiler.
