In the modern C language, you are required to provide a type for each function.  If you leave off
a type in a function declaration - at a minimum you will get a warning message.

But sometimes functions do not intend to return anything at all and so the `void` type was invented
to indicate that a function returns nothing.

The rule of requiring a type on a function definition even if it is `void`, allows the compiler to 
check to make sure all of your `return` values in a function match the expected return type.
