C Programming for Everybody (CC4E)
==================================

This web site is dedicated to learning the "classic" version of
the C Programming language from the 1978 book written by Brian Kernighan
and Dennis Ritchie.

This book places the reader in the middle
of the 1970's transition from a hardware-centered computer science
to a focus on writing portable and efficient software.  C was
used to develop operating systems like Unix, Minix, and Linux.

Programming languages like Python, Perl, Java, JavaScript, and
Ruby are all written in C.  Software like the early TCP/IP
networking implementations that made the Internet possible
were written in C.  And the first web browsers were written
in C.

C made major advances in computer architecture possible
because operating systems, compilers, and utilities could
be re-compiled on a new architecture once they built a C
compiler for the architecture.  So there is a very good chance
that much of the software that you use was either written
in C or written in a programming language that was written
in C.

So we study C less as a programming language to use
on a daily basis and more as the foundation of modern
software and computing.

The name "CC4E" comes is because the original UNIX command
to compile your C programs was `CC` - which stood for
"C Compiler".  Programmers from the 1970's and 1980's typed
`CC` to compile and run their first "hello world" programs
in C.
