This directory contains a working solution for assignment 18.

The program is broken up into 6 files.

	main.cc		this contains the main loop.  It builds the graph
				and handles interactive commands
	graph.h		this contains the graph class
	graph.cc	this contains all of the graph member functions.
	hash.h		this contains the hash table class
	hash.cc		this contains all of the hash member functions.
	list.h		this contains a template for a list class


hash.h, hash.cc and list.h should all be real familiar by now.  All of
the stuff pertinent to the graphs is in graph.cc.


Here are some things you should notice about this solution:

	The graph class contains all of the information about the graph.
	The graph member functions are all fairly small (except for
		 shortest path).	 
	The graph class contains a hash table and lists, but it does not
		know about the details of either.
	The hash table and the lists do not know about the graph class. 
	There are two types of lists.  Using templates makes this easy.



This is only one possible solution.

This solution is not perfect.  The output could be improved.  Arguments
could be made against the class design.  However it is relatively short,
relatively straightforward, and it produces correct answers (I think :) ).


A Makefile is also included.  In case you do not know about make, try
using the command 'man make'.  Briefly 'make' lets you easily compile a
project that is broken up into several files. If you copy all of these files 
into your own directory (including the Makefile), 'make' will compile all
of the files for you.  Feel free to look at Makefile.


If you have questions about any thing, email wagners5@cps.msu.edu .
