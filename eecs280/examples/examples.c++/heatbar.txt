/* Program heatbar - Calculate heat flows in a 100CM bar

* Bar initially starts out at 30 degrees C

* At 1 CM there is a 100 degree C heat source
* At 63 CM there is a 0 degree heat source
* At 100 CM there is a 60 degree source

* The program will print out the temperature at 10 50 and 80 CM
* After 1, 10, and 100 time steps
