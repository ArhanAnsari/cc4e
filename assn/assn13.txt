                 ASSIGNMENT 13 - CALL BY VALUE SUBROUTINE

Due Date: Before Lecture 11/04/91

This program has nothing to do with polynomials.  This program has two
purposes:

1)  Write a different program than a polynomial program from scratch
(with a few hints)

2) Explore how subroutines do pass by location (instead of pass by
value).

This program will read an un-specified number of employee time
records from input.  Each time record will contain an employee number 
(integer), an employee rate per hour (float) and number of hours
worked.

You are to print out the amount each employee should be paid.  Employees 
are paid time-and-a-half for hours worked above 40 hours.

The program would run as follows:

$ a.out
Enter time record: 123 5.00 40

Employee=123  Hours=40.0   Rate=5.00  Pay=200.00

Enter time record: 100 4.00 45

Employee=123  Hours=40.0   Rate=5.00  Pay=190.00

Enter time record: 199 5.25 10

Employee=123  Hours=40.0   Rate=5.00  Pay=52.20

Enter time record: 0 0 0 

$

The program should terminate when an employee number of zero is entered.

You must use a function to calculate the pay.  The function should have no
return value and must not use any global variables.  The calculated pay
should be passed out of the function using call by location.

The following is an outline of the program:

main() {
  int empno;
  float rate;
  float hours;
  float pay;

  while(1) {

    printf("Enter time record:");

    scanf("%d %f %f",&empno,&rate,&hours);
 
    if ( empno == 0 ) continue;

    /* Call function calcpay */ 

    /* Print out the output */

  }  /* End while */

} /* End main */

/* Function calcpay */

calcpay(p,r,h)

float *p;   /* Returned calculated pay */
float r;
float h;

{ /* Beginning of routine calcpay */


} /* End of routine calcpay */
