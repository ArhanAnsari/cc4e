                     ASSIGNMENT 15 - Strings

Due Date: Before Lecture 11/06/91

The purpose of this program is to work with strings (arrays of characters).

In this program you will not write the main program - you will only
write a function to process strings.  The name of the function is
process.  A main program will be provided which will call your
function.

The main program will call your function as follows:

   main() {

     char str[100];

     /* Other code */

     process(str);

     /* Other code */
   }

You could write a simple version of process that just printed the
string as follows:

   process(abc)

     char abc[100];

   {

     printf("abc=%s\n",abc);

   }

You are to perform the following steps in our function process:

1.  Print out the string you are passed.

2.  Count the number of characters in the string.

3.  If there are more than 10 characters in the string print out the
    9th character.

4.  Go through the string and replace every blank with a dash '-'

5.  Print out the new string with dashes.

The following would be an example execution of the program:

  $ a.out

  Calling function process

  String: Hi there and welcome to LBS290
  Count=30
  The ninth character is: a
  String: Hi-there-and-welcome-to-LBS290

  Back from function process

  Calling function process

  String: I love C
  Count=8
  String: I-love-C

  Back from function process

  Program finished

  $

The main program may call you with other strings - process should be able
to accept any string and process it.

To compile and run your program, use the following command:

  $ cc assn15.c /usr/usrs/crs/drv15.o
  $ a.out | more

More should be used because the program will generate several 
pages of output.
